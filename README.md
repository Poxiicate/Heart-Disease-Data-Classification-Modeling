# Heart-Disease-Data-Classification-Modeling
I used heart disease data to create predictable machine learning model + EDA

Project level ==> First aspect => EDA => Preprocessing => Modeling, Optimization, Evaluation 

Model used => naive bayes, svm, knn, decision tree, logistic regression, mlp 

This is my first modeling project
