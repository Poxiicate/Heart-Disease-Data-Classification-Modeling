Heart-Disease-Data-Classification-Modeling

I used heart disease data to create a predictive machine learning model + EDA 

Project level ==> First aspect => EDA => Preprocessing => Modeling, Optimization, Evaluation   

Model used => Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, logistic regression, MLP. 

This is my first modeling project!
